    <h2>Aso Rock</h2>
    <P>Aso Rock is a 400-meter rock which stands out as the most noticeable feature in the capital city of Nigeria, Abuja. The location is reputed as one of the lush tourist attractions in Nigeria, as it is a location in the Country's seat of power. Aso Rock houses the three major seats of power of the Nigerian Federal Government namely; Presidential Villa (Aso Rock Villa), National Assembly, and the Supreme Court, albeit the Aso Rock Villa building is the only structure built in the valley of the Rock. Although tourists are still allowed to visit this place, due to the rise in the menace 
        of terrorist attacks by Boko Haram in recent times, this access has become limited.</P>
